				Today’s generation has mixed mentality. Students become confuse when it
				comes to their school and college projects. They are blank. They know things but
				can’t project them correctly. If there would be a platform where these students
				can get help from the students across the country will be a great help. For such
				purpose, they need a platform where students / professionals across the nation
				can come forward and share their ideas/projects with everyone. Also, It is seen
				that collaborative projects help bring equally minded students together for
				bigger opportunities to attend afterwards.

	Driving on interstate roadways across country, tourists and travellers often run on
	tight expenses, paying uncalculated and unexpected amount on toll taxes. The
	time expensed on toll booths is also a factor of discomfort. The amounts to be
	paid as taxes are fixed but not known to people. In such cases, a relief would be
	to provide a calculated amount of toll to be paid for the route taken. Also,
	providing alternate routes with least amount of toll to be paid on road may add
	to relief of the users.</div>
